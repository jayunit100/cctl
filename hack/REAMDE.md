This file demonstrates what you need to do to install a CCTL cluster.

Depending on the VM type you use, you might need to setup your hypervisor to use 
eth0 as the private IP, rather then as a NAT destination.

To run this demo, modify the Vagrantfile if needed, and just run the cctl-demo.sh script.

Again: This script is purely for learning and understanding the inner workings of a CCTL

installation.
